        <li><strong><em>Description:</em></strong></li>
        <p>A slice of French lemon pie is not something I will easily turn down. No matter how sumptuous a meal may be, there will always be room for the refreshing zing of this beautiful dessert.</p>

        <li><strong><em>Ingredients:</em></strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li><em>150g all-purpose flour</em></li>
            <li><em>75g cold butter, cubed</em></li>
            <li><em>Pinch of fine sea salt</em></li>
            <li><em>2 tbsps raw cane sugar</em></li>
            <li><em>4 eggs</em></li>
            <li><em>90g butter</em></li>
            <li><em>juice of two lemons</em></li>
            <li><em>1 egg yolk</em></li>
            <li><em>150g caster sugar</em></li>
            <li><em>2 egg whites</em></li>
            <li><em>75g icing sugar</em></li>

        </ul>
        <br>
        <li><strong><em>Steps:</em></strong></li>
        <ol>
            <li><em>Mix flour with butter, salt and sugar in processor at low speed for about 20 seconds or until mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs.</em></li>
            <li><em>Add the whisked egg and pulse until dough comes together into a ball. If the dough seems dry, add a drop or two of iced water. Shape the dough into a disk, wrap it in cling film and refrigerate for at least 40 minutes</em></li>
            <li><em> Remove from the fridge 5-10 minutes before using it.</em></li>
            <li><em>Preheat the oven to 200°C. Grease a 25cm pie pan with a little butter. Roll out your dough on a floured surface and drape it over the prepared pan pressing it up against the edges. Trim off any excess dough. Line the dough with a piece of parchment paper and weigh it down with baking beans. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove the paper and beans and bake for an additional 3 minutes. </em></li>
            <li><em>In the meantime, make the filling. Melt the butter together with the lemon juice in a medium saucepan and allow to cool briefly. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, egg yolk and sugar until well combined. Add the melted butter and lemon very slowly to this mixture, whisking constantly as you go as to avoid curdling. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and allow it to cook slowly over a moderate heat for about 5-8 minutes, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon while it cooks.</em></li>
            <li><em>Once the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of the spoon, it is ready to be poured into the prepared shell. Bake the lemon pie for approximately 10 minutes at 200°C. To make the meringue, in a clean bowl, whisk the egg whites with half the sugar until almost stiff. Add in the rest of the sugar and whisk until the egg whites are firm and satiny. Spread this evenly over the top of the pie. </em></li>
            <li><em>Place the pie back in the oven (this time as high up as possible) and bake for 4-6 minutes, checking frequently to ensure it does not burn. Allow the pie to cool and refrigerate before eating.</em></li>
            
        </ol>
